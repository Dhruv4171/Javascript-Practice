# Beginner's Guide to JavaScript Comparisons

In JavaScript, comparing values is an essential part of writing logic and conditions in your programs. Understanding how comparisons work will help you write clearer and more predictable code. In this guide, we'll explore some common comparison operators and explain their behavior with different types of values.

## 1. Basic Comparison Operators

JavaScript provides several comparison operators for checking relationships between values. Here are some of the most common ones:

- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)
- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)

### Examples:

```javascript
console.log(2 > 1);  // true
console.log(2 >= 1); // true
console.log(2 < 1);  // false
console.log(2 <= 1); // false
console.log(2 == 1); // false
console.log(2 != 1); // true
